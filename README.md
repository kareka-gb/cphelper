## cphelper

This repository is mainly to create a cli tool that can help me submit my competitive programming problems faster. To minimize the time I take to run the solution, test it against the test cases and submit the solution to the judge. I plan to create three helper cli tools. For more info check [this](./How tools should work.md).
